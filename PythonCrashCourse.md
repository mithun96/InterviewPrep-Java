## Data Structure  

Lists are are mutable and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list. 

Tules are immutable, and usually contain a hterogenous sequence of elements that are acccessed via unpacking or indexing. 

Sets are an unordered collection with no duplicat elements. Used for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Can do mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference. 

Dictionaries are an unordered set of key: value pairs, with a requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary).
