Design an in-memory file system to simulate the following functions:

ls: Given a path in string format. If it is a file path, return a list that only contains this file's name. If it is a directory path, return the list of file and directory names in this directory. Your output (file and directory names together) should in lexicographic order.

mkdir: Given a directory path that does not exist, you should make a new directory according to the path. If the middle directories in the path don't exist either, you should create them as well. This function has void return type.

addContentToFile: Given a file path and file content in string format. If the file doesn't exist, you need to create that file containing given content. If the file already exists, you need to append given content to original content. This function has void return type.

readContentFromFile: Given a file path, return its content in string format.

 

Example:

Input: 
["FileSystem","ls","mkdir","addContentToFile","ls","readContentFromFile"]
[[],["/"],["/a/b/c"],["/a/b/c/d","hello"],["/"],["/a/b/c/d"]]

Performance Analysis

The time complexity:
ls command is O(m+n+klog(k)).  
	m refers to the length of the input string. 
	n refers to the depth of the last directory level in the given input for ls. 
	klog(k)klog(k) = We need to sort these names giving a factor of klog(k)klog(k).

mkdir command is O(m+n). 
	m refers to the length of the input string. 
	n refers to the depth of the last directory level in the given input for ls.

addContentToFile and readContentFromFile is O(m+n). 
	m refers to the length of the input string. 
	n refers to the depth of the last directory level in the given input for ls.

The advantage of this scheme of maintaining the directory structure is that it is expandable to 
	include even more commands easily. 

Renaming files/directories is also very simple, since all we need to do is to create a temporary 
	copy of the directory structure/file with a new name and delete the last entry.

Relocating a hierarchichal subdirectory structure from one directory to the other is also very easy, 
	ince, all we need to do is obtain the address for the corresponding subdirectory class, and 
		assign the same at the new positon in the new directory structure.

Extracting only directories or files list on any path is easy in this case, since we maintain 
	separate entires for dirsdirs and filesfiles.
